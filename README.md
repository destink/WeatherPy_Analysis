# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
The main objective of the project was to generate a random set of cities and their current weather information to determine an ideal temperate geographic location and hotel accessibility to create an itinerary for a vacation. 
## Results
Given the temperature parameters of a minimum temperature of 60 degrees and a maximum of 80 degrees and accessible hotel a dataframe was created with 712 possible locations were created. I then chose Peru as an optimal vacation destination and created an itinerary map with a starting and ending location with three stops along the coastline. 
## Summary 
In summary Peru's coastline would be an ideal vacation destination for anyone trying to find an ideal climate with lodging to relax and enjoy in. Once the initial analysis is performed an itinerary can also be created for anywhere on earth based on ideal temperature parameters.
